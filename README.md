# Overview

This is a collection of all of my solutions to the .NET course at PWr University.
Labs 0-4 are focused on HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and the rest on C#/.NET (besides lab13, focused on Angular).

Every lab was graded at 100%.

## Structure

Inside every labxy folder are files from the lecturer:
-PDFs with the lecture and lab tasks
-folders beginning with "Web..." containing example code
